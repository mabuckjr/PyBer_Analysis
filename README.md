# PyBer Analysis Remport
Resources used: Python, pandas, Jupyter Notebook, MatPlotLib, NumPy, and SciPy
## Overview of the Analysis
This project was given by a ride-sharing company called PyBer. The overall purpose of the project was to analyze the PyBer data to find the average fares per driver and ride, total number of available drivers and rides, and more. All of the analysis was sorted into "bins" based on the city type. The three different city types in this study were rural, suburban, and urban cities. Throughout the project, I was able to compare and contrast the sorted data between the city types to create tables and graphs. My last assignment was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, and then create a multi-line graph to compare the total weekly fares for each city-type.
